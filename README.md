A C11 game engine


## High-Level Project Directory Map 

Here is the top-level directory structure. Each component is explained in detail in the following sections.

```

├─── source/               	// ALL engine, editor, and game source code

## Detailed Directory Breakdown

```
/bin/ 				The executables (editor.exe, game.exe) and dynamic library (.dll, .so)
/build/ 			The destination for all compiled artifacts. It is generated by the build
					system and can be deleted and regenerated.
					(bin and build are exclused from version control)
/external/			

	All third-party libraries so they are self contained.

	* We check dependencies directly into our repository.
	* No reliance on package managers. 
	* Compiles onsistently on any machine.

/external/cglm/ 	A highly optimized math library for C.
/external/glfw/ 	Windowing and input library.
/external/stb/ 		Single-header public domain libraries (image loading, etc.).
/external/tcc/ 		The Tiny C Compiler, used for our C scripting backend.

/source/ 			Contains all the custom code for the engine and its applications.
/source/core/		Minimal, platform-agnostic, zero dependencys engine module.
	
	memory_system	Custom memory allocators (arena, pool).
	file_system 	Abstracted file I/O interfaces.
	module_system	The module loading and management system (pluggable architecture).
	data_structures	Optimized data structures (dynamic arrays, hash tables)
	foundation		A single header for basic types (u8, f32), macros, and assertions (used everywhere).

	* A lean core ensures that the engine's foundation is stable and fast. 
	* Dependency-free, can compile quickly and use it as a stable base for all other systems. 
	* The module system is the lynchpin; it allows the rest of the engine to be built as isolated units.

/source/modules/	

	* Conains the standard high level engine features.
	* Each subdirectory is a self-contained module that exposes its functionality through a C API.
	* These modules can depend on /core/ but should not, as a rule, depend on each other directly.
	* They communicate through the core systems or well-defined interfaces.	
	* This is the essence of a modular engine. The renderer doesn't know what physics is.
	* The scripting system only knows about functions and data types exposed via reflection.	
	* Development can work independently, developers only include modules they need.

	/renderer/		: Handles all graphics. 
	
	* Exposes an API like renderer_api->draw_mesh(...)
	* It can be swapped out (e.g., from Vulkan to DirectX).
	
	/physics/ 		: The physics simulation.	
	/audio/ 		: Sound playback and processing.	
	/ecs/ 			: The entity-component-system for managing game objects.	
	/script/ 		: The C scripting host. 
	
	It loads, compiles (using TCC), and manages the lifecycle of script files. 
	It uses the reflection data to bind engine functions to the script.
			
**/source/plugins/**

	* Similar to modules, but easily shareable and optional.
	* For third-party additions or features not considered "standard" for the engine.

	/plugin_steam/ 				: Steamworks integration.
	/plugin_procedural_mesh/ 	: A tool for generating procedural geometry.	
	
	* A formal plugins directory encourages a healthy ecosystem. 
	* A game developer can easily drop a new plugin into this folder.
	* The module system in /core/ will recognize and load it without engine source modification.
	
###/source/tools/

	* Purpose: Command-line utilities that support the development pipeline.
	* The most important is the reflection tool.
	
	/reflection_tool/ 			
	
	* A C program that parses specially commented C header files (.h) across the engine.
	* Generates .c files containing reflection data.
	* This data includes information about structs, their members, functions, and enums.

	Reasoning: This pre-build step is the "magic" that enables the rest of the engine to be so powerful.
	The generated reflection data is used by:

	1. The Editor: To automatically create property editors for any reflected C struct.
	2. The Serializer: To save and load component data to/from disk.
	3. The Scripting System: To expose engine functions and data types to C scripts without manual binding.
