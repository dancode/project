A C11 game engine


** High-Level Project Directory Map ** 

Here is the top-level directory structure. Each component is explained in detail in the following sections.

```
/engine/
├─── bin/                	// Build output (binaries)
├─── build/                	// Build output (intermediate files)
├─── docs/                 	// Engine documentation
├─── external/             	// Third-party libraries and dependencies
├─── source/               	// ALL engine, editor, and game source code
│    ├─── core/             // The heart of the engine: lean and dependency-free
│    ├─── modules/          // Standard engine modules (renderer, physics, etc.)

│    ├─── tools/            // Engine-related tools (reflection generator, etc.)

     └─── demo_game/
          ├─── assets/		// unprocessed raw assets.
		  └─── config/		//

** Detailed Directory Breakdown ** 

/bin/ 				The executables (editor.exe, game.exe) and dynamic library (.dll, .so)
/build/ 			The destination for all compiled artifacts. It is generated by the build
					system and can be deleted and regenerated.
					(bin and build are exclused from version control)
		
/external/			All third-party libraries so they are self contained.

/external/cglm/ 	A highly optimized math library for C.
/external/glfw/ 	Windowing and input library.
/external/stb/ 		Single-header public domain libraries (image loading, etc.).
/external/tcc/ 		The Tiny C Compiler, used for our C scripting backend.

```
Note: We check dependencies directly into our repository. This avoids reliance on system-wide package managers and guarantees that the engine will build consistently on any machine, today or five years from now.

```
/source/ 			Contains all the custom code for the engine and its applications.
/source/core/		Minimal, platform-agnostic, zero dependencys engine module

	memory_system	Custom memory allocators (arena, pool).
	file_system 	Abstracted file I/O interfaces.
	module_system	The module loading and management system (pluggable architecture).
	data_structures	Optimized data structures (dynamic arrays, hash tables)
	foundation.h	A single header for basic types (u8, f32), macros, and assertions (used everywhere).

```

	A lean core ensures that the engine's foundation is stable and fast. By making it dependency-free, we can compile it quickly and use it as a stable base for all other systems. The module_system is the lynchpin; it allows the rest of the engine to be built as isolated units.
